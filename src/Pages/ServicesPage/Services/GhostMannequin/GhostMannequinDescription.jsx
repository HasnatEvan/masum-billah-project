        Ghost Mannequin or Neck Joint Service at Graphics Amazon
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Think of a real model and photoshoot – that takes time and involves significant cost. 
        That’s why using a mannequin or dummy is a smarter and more budget-friendly option. 
        However, raw mannequin photos are not visually appealing and may add unwanted distractions 
        to the product image. This is where Graphics Amazon's neck joint or ghost mannequin 
        techniques come into play. Essentially, neck joint is a post-production process used 
        to remove the mannequin from the image while keeping the dress's structure intact and realistic.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The main goal of Graphics Amazon neck joint service is to remove the mannequin in such 
        a way that the apparel doesn’t appear to be hanging unnaturally. Instead, it creates a 
        clean, realistic look—as if an invisible model is wearing the dress. This is a form of 
        image manipulation that enhances product presentation.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck joint or ghost mannequin service is a vital solution for e-commerce stores and 
        online businesses, helping reduce production costs and providing clean, professional 
        visuals that boost customer trust and product appeal.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What Is Neck Joint Service?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck Joint is a specialized photo editing technique used by Graphics Amazon to remove 
        mannequins from images while displaying clothing and accessories in a realistic manner. 
        For this, the product must be photographed from the front, inside, and back. Then in 
        post-production, the mannequin is removed, and the missing inner or back areas are 
        added using the additional images. The result is a seamless visual where the outfit 
        appears worn by an invisible model.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Neck Joint on Ghost Mannequin:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Also known as mannequin removal, this process involves removing the mannequin and 
        adding the neck part from separate images. Photographers must capture front, inner, 
        and back views of the product. Our skilled editors at Graphics Amazon then stitch the 
        parts together, making this service essential for t-shirts, shirts, baby clothes, 
        women’s dresses, and more.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Bottom Joint:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Used for apparel where the bottom back part is longer, such as shirts, jackets, 
        sweaters, etc. After removing the mannequin, Graphics Amazon’s editors add the 
        missing bottom section to maintain a full and natural appearance.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Sleeve Joint Service:</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This applies to long-sleeved garments like hoodies, t-shirts, or sweaters. Our expert 
        editors at Graphics Amazon remove the mannequin from the sleeve area and insert the 
        proper sleeve part along with realistic shadows to give a natural, 3D hollow look.

        Remove the background and duplicate the layer (CTRL + J). <br />
        Create a new layer and fill it (CTRL + DELETE). <br />
        Return to the first layer, select the path, and apply the mask. <br />
