          At Graphics Amazon, we understand the impact of high-quality photo editing, and image reflection 
          is one of the most intricate processes. It adds realism and balance to landscape photos, making them 
          appear as if captured on glass or mirror surfaces. Incorrect reflections can distract viewers, 
          so professional execution is crucial. We offer flawless mirror reflection services for your images.

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Reflection Service?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Reflection service adds shadows or mirror-like effects beneath images to enhance elegance. 
        Our experts use advanced Photoshop tools to produce realistic 2D (mirror or water surface) 
        and 3D reflections, improving depth and visual intensity.

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Why is Reflection Service Necessary?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Reflection services are essential for e-commerce, magazines, design agencies, publishers, 
        and product photographers. They make images more professional, polished, and visually engaging.

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">How Does Reflection Service Work?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Key elements of the image are selected, separated, and inverted to create a realistic reflection. 
        Axis adjustments and shadow placement ensure the reflection enhances the image naturally. 
        This approach captures viewers’ attention and improves product appeal for online sales.
