          Photo Restoration is the process of retrieving damaged images caused by natural or man-made factors. Digital tools and editing techniques remove aging effects and damage, reviving the photograph to its original, vibrant state.

        Before digital cameras, photos were only print-outs that aged over time. Now, using modern technology, old photos can be restored, fixing scratches, smudges, fades, torn edges, and more.
