          In Adobe Photoshop, the clipping path is a vector graphic that outlines an object, 
          tracing around its edges. Clipping paths are used to remove unwanted objects 
          or wrap text around items. Clipping path service increases website credibility 
          and is important for image editing.

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Categories of Clipping Paths</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        There are three types of clipping paths: simple, multi-clipping, and complex. Each 
        is used depending on the image complexity and editing needs.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Simple Clipping Path</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Simple clipping paths are used to remove backgrounds from product photos and for 
        basic edits. Designers use Adobe Photoshop's pen tool to create paths around or 
        inside images to make modifications and enhance photo aesthetics for eCommerce.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Multi Clipping Path</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Multi clipping path involves applying two or more clipping layers in a single photo. 
        It allows editing each part of an image individually for better control and precision.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Complex Clipping Path</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Complex clipping paths are used for intricate images to remove or replace backgrounds, 
        adjust colors, shadows, shapes, logos, and more. More than 10 paths in an image 
        usually indicate a complex clipping path, commonly used for fur, hair, or images 
        with multiple holes and transparency.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        This technique is often applied to complex eCommerce images like fences, gates, 
        or multi-layered products. It requires many anchor points to isolate the image precisely.
      </p>
