        Ghost Mannequin or Neck Joint Service at Graphics Amazon
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Think of a real model and photoshoot – that takes time and involves significant cost. 
        That’s why using a mannequin or dummy is a smarter and more budget-friendly option. 
        However, raw mannequin photos are not visually appealing and may add unwanted distractions 
        to the product image. This is where <strong>Graphics Amazon's neck joint or ghost mannequin techniques</strong> 
        come into play. Essentially, neck joint is a post-production process used to remove the mannequin 
        from the image while keeping the dress's structure intact and realistic.

        that the apparel doesn’t appear to be hanging unnaturally. Instead, it creates a clean, 
        realistic look—as if an invisible model is wearing the dress. This is a form of image manipulation 
        that enhances product presentation.

        What Is Neck Joint Service?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Neck Joint is a specialized photo editing technique used by Graphics Amazon to remove mannequins 
        from images while displaying clothing and accessories in a realistic manner. For this, the product 
        must be photographed from the front, inside, and back. Then in post-production, the mannequin is removed, 
        and the missing inner or back areas are added using the additional images. The result is a seamless 
        visual where the outfit appears worn by an invisible model.
