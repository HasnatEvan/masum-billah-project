        and graphic design. At Graphics Amazon, we understand the importance of presenting a polished

      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Types of Image Masking Services We Offer:</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Our team at Graphics Amazon employs an array of expert masking techniques to ensure that your
        images stand out. We offer comprehensive image masking services, including the following:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Alpha Masking (Photoshop)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Alpha masking is a technique that uses the color channels of an image to create precise
        selections. This allows us to isolate complex areas such as hair, fur, or fine textures,
        providing a clean, seamless background removal or enhancement.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Clipping Masks</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Clipping masks are used to control visibility between layers. For example, if you want to fill
        text with an image, the clipping mask will ensure the image appears only within the text's
        boundaries. This technique is ideal for product catalogs, promotional materials, and digital
        advertisements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Layer Masking</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Layer masking allows us to selectively hide or reveal portions of an image, providing subtle
        transitions or the removal of unwanted elements. This method is often used for blending images
        together, enhancing composite photography, or creating a visually appealing separation between
        layers.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Vector Masking</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Vector masking is commonly used in graphic design to maintain sharp, clean edges. Unlike raster
        layers, vector masks create paths with anchor points that ensure high-resolution, scalable
        images. This technique is especially useful for logos, illustrations, and sharp-edged graphics.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Gradient Masking (Photoshop)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Gradient masking enables a smooth transition between visible and hidden areas of an image. It’s
        perfect for blending edges or creating soft fades, such as blending the sky in a landscape photo
        or seamlessly merging background and foreground elements.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Selective Adjustment Brush (Lightroom)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Lightroom’s Selective Adjustment Brush allows for precise control over specific areas of your
        photo. With this tool, you can adjust the opacity and refine details without affecting the rest
        of the image, ensuring that every part of your photo is enhanced to perfection.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Gradient Filter Masks (Lightroom)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Gradient Filter in Lightroom is a powerful tool for adjusting exposure, contrast, and color
        in specific areas of an image. Ideal for fine-tuning landscapes, portraits, or product shots,
        this technique gives you full control over the photo’s overall tone and mood.
      </p>
