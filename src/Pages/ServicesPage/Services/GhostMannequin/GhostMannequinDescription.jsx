          Think of a real model and photoshoot, which takes time and is expensive. 
          That’s why a dummy is the best solution. Taking a photo without a mannequin 
          isn’t catchy and may add noise to your product. Usually, neck joints and 
          ghost mannequins are the same. A neck joint removes the mannequin from the image.

        so that it looks like an invisible model is wearing it. Neck joining or ghost mannequin 
        is a type of image manipulation service.

        Neck joint is a post-production technique to remove mannequins and display clothes 
        & accessories. The product is photographed from the front, inside, and back. 
        The mannequin is then removed and replaced with the inside/back view to give the 
        illusion of an invisible person wearing the clothes.
