        product in a clean, professional manner.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">How We Remove Background?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Graphics Amazon backgrounds removes using various tools through Adobe Photoshop. The best 
        background can be removed with the Photoshop Pen tool. The technique chosen depends on the 
        complexity of the image and the required output. Here are the methods we use:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Clipping Path</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Clipping Path technique is a manual, hand-drawn removal method that provides precise, 
        high-quality results. It involves outlining the subject of the image with a pen tool to 
        remove the background. This method is ideal for detailed images and is particularly 
        effective when the photo is zoomed in to highlight intricate details.
     <ul className="mb-4 space-y-2 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <span className="mt-2 h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-black flex-shrink-0"></span>
    <span>
      This process works best for clean-cut, detailed images, where precise
      separation of the product from its background is required.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <span className="mt-2 h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-black flex-shrink-0"></span>
    <span>
      It’s highly effective for product images such as jewelry, apparel, and
      objects with clear-cut edges.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>


      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Image Masking</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Image masking is another technique we use, especially when the image has complex elements 
        like hair or fur. For this process, we use tools such as the background eraser tool, refine 
        edge tool, and magic eraser tools to create smooth edges and remove the background effectively.
     <ul className="mb-4 space-y-2 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <span className="mt-2 h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-black flex-shrink-0"></span>
    <span>
      Image masking is particularly useful for images with fuzzy elements like
      hair, fabrics, or fur, which are difficult to handle with clipping paths
      alone.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <span className="mt-2 h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-black flex-shrink-0"></span>
    <span>
      This technique ensures that every detail, from delicate hair strands to
      soft fabric edges, is retained while the background is removed.
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
