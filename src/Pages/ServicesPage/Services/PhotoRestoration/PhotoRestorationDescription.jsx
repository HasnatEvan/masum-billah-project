        <strong>
          Photo restoration is the process of recovering damaged images, whether due to natural causes or human error. Digital tools and editing techniques eliminate visible signs of aging and damage, restoring photos to their original, vibrant state.

      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Before digital photography, printed photos naturally degraded over time, developing stains, scratches, tears, fading, and other forms of damage. Graphics Amazon restores these photos to their former glory, ensuring your memories are preserved.
