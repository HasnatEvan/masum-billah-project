      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Image Cleaning Service is a service that removes unwanted objects, noise, spots, dust, shadows, etc. from any image. Basically, image cleaning is done using several tools of Photoshop. The image cleaning depends entirely on the type of image. Each type of image has a different symmetry and is fixed while keeping the original form. After working with many projects and clients, our editors have expertise in this sector. Most of the time, we get product catalog pictures from e-commerce stores. These images may have spots, loose yarn, shadows, or noise, which are removed through image cleaning.
