        Raster to Vector Conversion Services at Graphics Amazon
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        In our daily lives, images are typically categorized into two types: Raster Images and Vector
        Images. Raster images are made up of tiny pixels or dots and are commonly used across various
        digital platforms. In contrast, Vector images are created using mathematical formulas, making
        them highly scalable and more adaptable for various uses. At Graphics Amazon, we provide
        exceptional Raster to Vector Conversion services, ensuring your images are transformed into
        scalable vector graphics using Adobe Illustrator.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Why Choose Vector Images?</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Raster images are pixel-based, which means they often lose quality when enlarged. This makes
        them less suitable for projects requiring scalability. On the other hand, Vector images retain
        their sharpness and clarity regardless of how much they are resized. This quality makes vector
        images a preferred choice for internet viewing and printing, as they can be easily indexed and
        searched.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Who Needs Vector Images and Why?</h2>
